# Dungeon Slayer
This is simple rougelike console game prototype written in C#. This is by no means final game and it's pretty much simple project for an assignment I had for programming classes.

## Features
The following features had been implemented:
  * Main Menus with bunch of options.
  * Procedural generation of a map using cellurar automata.
  * Movement of the player in the grid (with diagonal movement).
  * Simple combat system influenced by player's stats: luck, agility & power.

## Possible improvements
  * Currently this app is borring. Gameplay is pretty much in fetal stage. No inventory, spells etc. you could expect from RPG (possible improvement in the future).
  * After combating goblin, its avatar sometimes flickers on the map just after exiting combat mode. The whole rendering process is rather clunky but it's it's nice place to start. :)
